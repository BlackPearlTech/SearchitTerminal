*** Searchit ***

Terminal Based Search Customizer

Searchit is a software what allows you to make customized internet searches from your terminal.
Currently Searchit provides support for 9 browsers and 24 websites.

If you are a linux user, you might find yourself working in terminal quit a lot (and its very good).
Now imagine how many times you had to search something and you had to leave your terminal,
open your browser, go to a specific site, search whatever you wanted to search.
But with Searchit you don't even have to leave your terminal for a quick internet search.
Just type a command and Searchit will automatically open your browser,
go to the specific site and search it for you.
Some Examples:

# search "python" in google
searchit -ggl python
# search "apple" in duckduckgo
searchit -ddg apple
# search "eiffel tower" in wikipedia
searchit -wiki eiffel tower
# search "hunger games" in youtube
searchit -ytb hunger Games
# search "ip camera" in shodan
searchit -sdn ip camera

Also you can select a default search site. And then you can just type "searchit"
then your search query and Searchit will automatically search it in your default search site

Example: If you selected your default search site "google",
then you can just type this.

searchit bangladesh
# it will automatically search "bangladesh" in google
searchit iron man
# it will automatically search "iron man" in google

For terminal only situations like server or workstation.
You can combine Searchit with terminal based text browsers
like W3m (http://w3m.sourceforge.net/),
Links (http://www.jikos.cz/~mikulas/links//),
Lynx (https://lynx.browser.org/) and browse the internet inside your terminal.
Searchit provides supports for these 3 text based web browsers.
Just set your desire one as default browser and you are good to go.

Last but not least
For too much shortcut lovers
Searchit also has two predefined custom commands for instant search in Google and DuckDuckGo


duckit burger
# it will search burger in duckduckgo
googleit pizza
# it will search pizza in google


In near future Searchit will provide more **search options for individual sites** for better and more accurate search customization and also support for more and more websites.
Now you know why you need Searchit
