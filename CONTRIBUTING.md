 ## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Searchit. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

> **Please make sure your copy of the software is up-to-date.**

When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report).

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.


#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).
Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Include screenshots** For describing a bug properly you can provide screenshots of the situation.
* **Include Your Operating System Information.** Which distribution of linux you are using. Version of that distribution.

### Providing Suggestion And Ideas

You can provide new ideas and suggestions for future update.
Your ideas and suggestions are always valuable to the community. And via contributing you became a member of this community too.

* ** Suggest new web sites.** As you know Searchit brings support for many web sites. A lot of the web sites have search features and many of them are pretty useful. If you think that a web site should be included, then let me know. I will review the website and probably will include supports for the site in our next update. Just make sure two things:
 * The website is **Not An Adult Website**
 * General/Group of People use the website often.


* ** Suggest New Features**. If you think there is a feature we could add in this software feel free to share with us. Maybe your brilliant idea will be the next goal for us.
 * Make sure your idea is related to this software
 * And let us know how your idea/feature can help you and others

### Developing

If you understand how this software works, you can contribute as a developer. Hence I'm single-handedly developing this software, your skills of developing can help me a lot.
 * You can provide solutions for open issues.
 * Or you can pick a issue and contribute the changes needed to solve the issue.

Either way you are doing a great job and I appreciate that.

### Promoting

As you already know I'm the only one behind the whole thing and I am a regular teenage college student. For me promoting Searchit is quit a bit heavy task. I don't even know that much people. So if you let your friends know about this software or post it about in social media or any other work what can help this software to reach more people then it will help a lot. A lot means **Actually A lot.**


Last but not least thanks a lot again for doing your part. Even if you are unable to do any of this contribution that's ok. Even if you just use this software I will consider my self successful. Which is very helpful for my mental health. Thank you again.
